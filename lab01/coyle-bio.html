    Hi! My name is Lily Coyle. I am a double major at Syracuse studying Communication and Rhetorical Studies, in the School of Visual and Performing Arts, and Information Management and Technology, with a concentration in Data Analytics, in the School of Information Studies.

I am interested in combining my passion for communications with tech to help businesses succeed. I am an effective communicator, great problem solver, and work well under pressure. I have great time management skills and am incredibly organized. 


I hold many leadership positions in the clubs I am a part of, and I love being involved, and being busy. I have been in my sorority since I was a freshman and I have held multiple positions since joining. I am currently the philanthropy chair and am looking forward to our upcoming events! I am a writer and editor for two different on campus magazines and the secretary of the Women in Technology Club! Finally, I am a peer mentor in the Orange Success Program. 


Outside of school, I love to read and exercise. I am currently in the process of reading all the classics as decided by Penguin Publishing House. This is a long list of 100 classics that can be found on the Penguin website. Additionally, I have just begun training to run a half marathon. I am hoping to run a full marathon by the time I graduate!


I love music and can be found always making and sharing playlists to my friends and family. If you see me on campus, odds are I have my air pods in. A fun fact about my music taste is that I don’t have a favorite genre, but I have a new favorite song every day.


I also love movies and recently started watching the Marvel Cinematic Universe in timeline order! The week before I came back to school, I watched the first seven. Unfortunately, I don’t think I will have any time the rest of this semester to do that again.


Finally, I am a huge jeopardy fan and look forward to playing along at seven every night. 


I am a middle child in between two brothers and have a very big family. I have more than 30 cousins between both sides of my family! My love for running comes from my dad and my love for reading comes from my mom. However, when the five of us watch Jeopardy together things get heated …
