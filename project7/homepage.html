            Playlist #1 – Broadway Bops<br>
            The reason I made it: I am a theatre kid at heart. I learned to dance and sing at the age of five and kept up with it until I went to high school. When I got to high school, I had to decide between being a theatre kid or an athlete, I unfortunately couldn’t do both. I chose to be a three-sport athlete, yet I never lost my love for performing arts. This playlist is a collection of songs and albums from my favorite shows. While I have only seen a few of these shows on Broadway I can still put an entire performance on while listening to this playlist.<br>

        </p>
        
        <p>
            Playlist #2 – Country Boy I love You<br>
            The reason I made it: While country music is a heavily criticized and often despised genre of music, I can’t help but be a fan. Put me on a boat in the summer and I will refuse to listen to anything else. This playlist features old and new country music, some of the hits off the top charts and some more lowkey country vibes. Rumor has it if you put this playlist on a cowboy hat will magically appear on your head!<br>

            Playlist #3 – Get it Together Lily but Listen to These Sad Songs First<br>
            The reason I made it: I am sure by the name of this playlist you can imagine the state I was in when I made it. If you guessed a state of misery, you are correct! This playlist is for the broken hearted. I made this playlist to cry to while I shoveled ice cream in my mouth while reading sad romance novels. Just kidding. Unless … This playlist features sad songs across a number of genres. Some Taylor Swift, some Adele, and lots of Sam Smith. This playlist even has some sad country and Broadway musical jams. There is a song for every person with a heart broken into a million pieces.<br>

    Playlist #4 – HAGS<br>
    The reason I made it: As you may or may not know HAGS stands for have a great summer. The reason for making this playlist is not to solely have a good summer but a good time. This playlist is for hitting the town. It is for driving with your windows down and singing in the shower. The genres range from dance to electronic and house. Within this playlist you can find Snakehips, Cash Cash, the Chainsmokers, Loud Luxury, and more. You can’t go wrong playing this playlist at a party or while you are getting ready to go to one. <br>

    Playlist #5 – Sappy Songs<br>
    The reason I made it: Contrary to the Get it Together Lily but Listen to These Sad Songs First Playlist Sappy Songs is for those who are in love. To be quite frank this playlist hasn’t been updated in years. However, it features all the songs I liked to listen and relate to when I was in love. This playlist was made for Sunday morning bagel runs and baking together in the kitchen. A little Jack Johnson, a little Michael Buble, and a lot of Taylor swift. Maybe one day I will listen to this playlist again and smile, but that day is not today.<br>

    Playlist #6 – Sophia 2<br>
    The reason I made it: While I cannot disclose the reasoning for the name of this playlist, I can describe its contents. This playlist is a large collection of Hip Hop, Rap, R&B, Soul, and pop. However, the “pop” featured on this playlist is not the mainstream pop you may be thinking of. This playlist is an ode to my favorite artists and genre of music. Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, and Brockhampton are just a few of the artists featured on this playlist. This playlist came to be when I was a sophomore in high school and has only grown since. It would take more than a day to listen to the playlist all the way through. This has to be my favorite playlist hands down and is often the one I put on when I decide to put music on. <br>
